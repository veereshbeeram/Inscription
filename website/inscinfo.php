<div class="post-content">
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>hese are some important instructions and details about the inscription judge.</p>
<ul>
<li>The judge tries to give you an accurate feedback on your code run. Generally you have the following status codes for your submission.</li>
<ul>
<li>ACCEPTED  -- the code ran properly and the solution generated was correct.</li>
<li>WRONG_ANSWER -- the code ran without errors but the solution generated was wrong.</li>
<li>COMPILIATION_ERROR -- code failed during compiliation itself.</li>
<li>TIME_LIMIT_EXCEEDED  -- code ran for more than specified time limit.</li>
<li>SEGMENTATION_FAULT  -- code threw segmentation fault during runtime.</li>
<li>ARITHMETIC_EXCEPTION -- code threw arithmetic faults like divide By Zero during runtime.</li>
<li>RUN_TIME_ERROR -- Code threw some error at runtime.</li>
<li>WAITING -- your code has not yet been evaluted. It is waiting in the queue.</li>
<p style="text-align:center">For TEXT submission you have only ACCEPTED/WRONG_ANSWER.</p>
</ul>



<li>For IPSC format problems the language of submission is TEXT. You can also find "IPSC format" marked next to timing information on the corresponding problem page.</li>
<li>For some IPSC problems you will need to download the Test case file. The link to download the textcase file is provided at the bottom of the corresponding problem page.</li>
<li>A trial run will be held before the actual contest. Kindly make sure you attend it. This will give you a feel of the judge and also help you iron out trivial coding issues (like handling INPUT/OUTPUT). </li>
<li>Compilers and Runtime information,</li>
<ul>
<li> All executions are in 32-bit environment.</li>
<li> gcc and g++ 4.4.3 compilers will be used.</li>
<li> SUN java 6u21 jdk will be used for compiliation and running of java programs.</li>
<li> windows users can use DEV-C++. Be sure to write ANSI-C compatible C code. Don't use headers like CONIO.H</li>
<li> During compilation the math libraries are linked for both c and cpp (i.e the solutions are compiled with -lm option).</li>
</ul>
<li>The appearance of captchas on problem submission page are random.</li>
</ul>
