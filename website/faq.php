Huge memory leaks can also crash your program. Also check if you are attempting to use systemcalls/files/network..etc, check rules and instruction pages for more details.</p>

				<p><span class="dropcap">Q</span>What is this IPSC format?</p>
   				<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>IPSC stands for "Internet Problem Solving Contest". In this contest unlike regular programming contests you are just required to submit the solution (i.e final output). You could have got the output by writing code/ by manual calculations,etc. Inscription this time has couple of such problems. You are just required to submit the final output file for such problems. The problem description will clearly tell you that the problem is IPSC format for these kind of problems.Also the time limit will be 0 secs. A comment "IPSC format" will be marked next to timing information.</p>

				<p><span class="dropcap">Q</span>Your judge is already running? what will be different in trial run??</p>
   				<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>the judge currently is on perpetual run state, with the corresponding evaluator running at predefined intervals. But in trial run, we shall have decent quality questions and the evaluator will be running though out the contest, doing real-time evaluations of your solutions as soon as they are submitted.</p>
   				<p><span class="dropcap">Q</span>I registered for inscription, but my teamname is listed as TempXXYYZZPP. I never created this team.</p>
                <hr/>
   				<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>The engineer site had bug in the registration process initially. So registrations done at that time have been assigned a temporary team name by us. You can leave that team and re-register using a teamname of your choice.</p>
